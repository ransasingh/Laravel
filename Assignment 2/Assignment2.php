    <h3>Q1.What Is Object Oriented Programming? </h3>
    <p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</p>

    <p> programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data,
        while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>


    <p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
    <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
    <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
    <li>OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
    <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>

    <h2> OOPS Stand Four Piller:-</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Abstraction</li>
        <li>Polymorphism</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Q2.What Are Properties Of Object Oriented Systems? </h2>

    <ul>
        <b> Properties of Object Oriented Systems</b>
        <li>Class</li>
        <li>Object</li>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Abstraction</li>
        <li>Polymorphism</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Class</b></li>
    <p>A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain.
        In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.</p>
    <p>Class is a collection of data member and member fucntions only</p>
    <p>without instantce of class we are not able to access the property of that class</p>

    <li><b>Object</b></li>
    <p>with the help of NEW keyword we can create an object of class</p>
    <p>A class defines an individual instance of the data structure. We define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as an instance.</p>
    <li><b>Encapsulation</b></li>

    <p>Encapsulation is a process to wrap data into single unit its done through class, Class is an example of encapsulation</p>
    <p>Encapsulation is a concept where we encapsulate all the data and member functions together to form an object.</p>

    <li><b>Inheritance</b></li>
    <p>It is a concept of accessing the features of one class from another class. If we inherit the class features into another class, we can access both class properties. We can extends the features of a class by using 'extends' keyword.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Types of Inheritance</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Single Inheritance</li>
        <li>Multilevel Inheritance</li>
        <li>Multiple Inheritance</li>
        <li>Hierarchical Inheritance</li>
        <li>Hybrid Inheritance</li>
    </ul>
    <li>PHP only support <b>Single Inheritance</b> And <b>Multilevel Inheritance</b></li><br>

    <li><b>Abstraction</b></li>
    <p>Any representation of data in which the implementation details are hidden (abstracted).</p>
    <p>we cant create an object of abstrated Class</p>
    <p>abstrated Class only able to contain abstacted method.</p>
    <p>An abstract method is a method that is declared, but not implemented in the code.</p>
    <p>An abstract class or method is defined with the <b> abstract </b> keyword</p>

    <li><b>Polymorphism</b></li>
    <p>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond differently based on the same message.</p>
    <p>To implement polymorphism in PHP, you can use either abstract classes or interfaces.</p>
    <p>Generally, it is of two types: compile-time (overloading) and run time (overriding), but polymorphism in PHP does not support overloading, or in other words, compile-time polymorphism</p>

            <td>5.Interfaces are used to define a contract that classes must adhere to. They specify what methods a class must implement, without declaring how they should be implemented. Interfaces are used to establish a common interface across different classes or to achieve polymorphism.</td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Q4. What Is Overloading? </h2>
    <li> Overloading in PHP provides means to dynamically create properties and methods.</li>
    <li>These dynamic entities are processed via magic methods, one can establish in a class for various action types.</li>
    <li>All overloading methods must be defined as Public.</li>
    <li>After creating object for a class, we can access set of entities that are properties or methods not defined within the scope of the class.</li>
    <li>Such entities are said to be overloaded properties or methods, and the process is called as overloading.</li>
    <li>For working with these overloaded properties or functions, PHP magic methods are used.</li>
    <b>Some of the magic methods which is useful for property overloading.</b>
    <li>__set(): It is triggered while initializing overloaded properties.</li>
    <li>__get(): It is utilized for reading data from inaccessible Properties.</li>
    <li>__isset(): This magic method is invoked when we check overloaded properties with isset() function.</li>
    <li>__unset(): This function will be invoked on using PHP unset() for overloaded properties.</li>

    <b>example of function overloading</b>
    <pre>
        class myclass{
            public function __call($name,$arguments){
                echo "function name:".$name;
                echo "function arguments:";
                print_r($arguments);
            }
        }
        $myobj= new myclass;
        echo   $myobj->testing(); //without parameter
        echo   $myobj->testing(10,20); //with parameter
    </pre>
    <br>

    <h2>Q5. What Is T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM (Scope Resolution Operator (::) with Example </h2>
    <p>The Scope Resolution Operator (also called Paamayim Nekudotayim) or, the double colon, is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

        When referencing these items from outside the class definition, use the name of the class.

        It's possible to reference the class using a variable. The variable's value can not be a keyword (e.g. self, parent and static).</p>

    <b>Example of Scope Resolution Operator</b>
    <pre>

            class myclass
            {
                public static $staticdatamember = "hello";
                
                public static function staticfunction()
                {
                    echo "Static method Called";
                }
            }
            <b>// Accessing a static datamember using the Scope Resolution Operator</b>
            echo myclass::$staticdatamember;
            <b>// Calling a static method using the Scope Resolution Operator</b>
            echo myclass::staticfunction();
        </pre>

    <h2>Q9. How to Call Parent Constructor? </h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Call the constructor of a parent class from within the constructor of a child class using the parent::__construct() syntax. This allows you to execute the initialization logic defined in the parent class before adding any additional logic specific to the child class</li>

    <h2>Q10.Are Parent Constructor Called Implicitly When Create An ObjectOf Class? </h2>
    <br>
    <uL>
        <li>
            <p>No, the parent constructor is not called implicitly when creating an object of a class in PHP. If a class has a constructor defined, it must be explicitly called from the child class constructor if you want to execute the parent's constructor logic.</p>
        </li>
    </uL>

    <h2>Q11.What Happen, If Constructor Is Defined As Private Or Protected? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When a constructor is defined as private or protected in a class, it affects the accessibility of the constructor and the way objects of that class can be created.</li>

    <h2>Q12. What are PHP Magic Methods/Functions? List them Write program for Static Keyword in PHP? </h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>In PHP, magic methods (also known as magic functions) are special methods that start with a double underscore (__). </li>
        <li> These methods are automatically called by PHP at certain points during the execution of a class. They allow you to define custom behaviors for various operations and provide additional functionality to your classes.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>some commonly used magic methods in PHP:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>__construct: The constructor method, called when an object is created from the class.</li>
                <li>__destruct: The destructor method, called when an object is no longer referenced or when the script execution ends.</li>
                <li>__get: Called when accessing inaccessible properties.</li>
                <li>__set: Called when assigning a value to an inaccessible property.</li>
                <li>__isset: Called when using isset() or empty() on an inaccessible property.</li>
                <li>_unset: Called when using unset() on an inaccessible property.</li>
                <li>__call: Called when invoking inaccessible methods.</li>
                <li>__callStatic: Called when invoking inaccessible static methods.</li>
                <li>__toString: Called when an object is used in a string context.</li>
                <li>__clone: Called when cloning an object.</li>
                <li>__sleep: Called before serializing an object.</li>
                <li>__wakeup: Called after unserializing an object.</li>
                <li>__invoke: Called when an object is treated as a function.</li>
                <li>__set_state: Called when using var_export() to export an object.</li>
                <li>__debugInfo: Called when using var_dump() or print_r() on an object.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Write program for Static Keyword in PHP? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>To use these static methods, we don't need to create an instance of the class. Instead, we directly call the methods using the class name and the scope resolution operator `::`.</li>
                <pre>class mathes{
                public static function add($num1,$num2){
                    return $num1+$num2;

            }

        echo mathes::add(10,20);// Output = 30;

    <h2>Q13.Create multiple Traits and use it in to a single class? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes. Traits can have methods and abstract methods that can be used in multiple classes, and the methods can have any access modifier (public, private, or protected).</li>
        <li>Traits are declared with the <b> trait </b> keyword.</li>
        <li>To use a trait in a class, use the <b> use </b> keyword</li>
